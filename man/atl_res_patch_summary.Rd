\title{Summary of patch data}
\usage{
atl_res_patch_summary(data, summary_variables = c(), summary_functions = c())
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or data.table containing movement data. Must include
columns: \code{tag} (ID), \code{x}, \code{y} (coords),
\code{time} (timestamp), and \code{patch} (patch ID).}

\item{summary_variables}{Character vector of variable names in \code{data}
for additional summaries. Variables should be numeric or compatible with
the summary functions.}

\item{summary_functions}{Character vector of function names
to apply to each variable in \code{summary_variables}. Functions must work
on numeric vectors (e.g., "mean" or "median").}
}
\value{
A data.table with one row per \code{tag} and \code{patch} containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{nfixes}: Number of fixes in the patch.
\item \code{x_mean}, \code{x_median}, \code{x_start}, \code{x_end}: Summary
stats of x.
\item \code{y_mean}, \code{y_median}, \code{y_start}, \code{y_end}: Summary
stats of y.
\item \code{time_mean}, \code{time_median}, \code{time_start},
\code{time_end}: Summary stats of time.
\item Additional summaries from \code{summary_variables} and
\code{summary_functions}.
\item \code{dist_in_patch}:
Total distance (in m) travelled within the patch.
\item \code{dist_bw_patch}:
Distance (in m) between end of previous and start of current patch.
\item \code{time_bw_patch}:
Time (in sec) elapsed between end of previous and start of current patch.
\item \code{disp_in_patch}:
Straight-line (in m) displacement between start and end of patch.
\item \code{duration}: Duration spent (in sec) within the patch.
}
}
\description{
Computes summary statistics of movement data grouped by patches for each
individual tag. Calculates spatial and temporal summaries within each patch,
distances traveled inside patches, distances and time intervals between
patches, displacement within patches, and patch duration. Additional
user-specified summary variables and functions can also be applied
dynamically.
}
\details{
Converts input data to data.table if needed and filters out rows with missing
patch assignments. All summaries are calculated by \code{tag} and
\code{patch}.Distance calculations use Euclidean distance in x-y coordinate
space.
