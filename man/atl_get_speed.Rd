\title{Calculate instantaneous speed.}
\usage{
atl_get_speed(data, x = "x", y = "y", time = "time", type = c("in"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe or similar which must have the columns
specified by \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{time}.}

\item{x}{The x coordinate.}

\item{y}{The y coordinate.}

\item{time}{The timestamp in seconds since the UNIX epoch.}

\item{type}{The type of speed (incoming or outgoing) to return.
Incoming speeds are specified by \code{type = "in"}, and outgoing speeds
by \code{type = "out"}.}
}
\value{
A vector of numerics representing speed.
The first position is assigned a speed of NA.
}
\description{
Returns speed in metres per time interval. The time interval is dependent
on the units of the column specified in \code{TIME}.
Users should apply this function to \emph{one individual at a time}, ideally by
splittng a dataframe with multiple individuals into a list of dataframes.

\examples{
\dontrun{
data$speed_in <- atl_get_speed(data,
  x = "x", y = "y",
  time = "time", type = c("in")
)
