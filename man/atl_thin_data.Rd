\title{Thin tracking data by resampling or aggregation.}
\usage{
atl_thin_data(
  data,
  interval = 60,
  id_columns = NULL,
  method = c("subsample", "aggregate")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Tracking data to aggregate. Must have columns \code{X} and
\code{Y}, and a numeric column named \code{TIME}.}

\item{interval}{The interval in seconds over which to aggregate.}

\item{id_columns}{Column names for grouping columns.}

\item{method}{Should the data be thinned by subsampling or aggregation.
If resampling (\code{method = "subsample"}), the first position of each group
is taken. If aggregation (\code{method = "aggregate"}), the group positions'
mean is taken.}
}
\value{
A dataframe aggregated taking the mean over the interval.
}
\description{
Uniformly reduce data volumes with either aggregation or resampling
(specified by the \code{method} argument) over an interval specified in
seconds using the \code{interval} argument.
Both options make two important assumptions:
(1) that timestamps are named \verb{TIME', and (2) all columns except the identity columns can be averaged in \code{R}. While the }subsample' option returns a thinned dataset with all columns from
the input data, the \verb{aggregate' option drops the column \code{covxy}, since this cannot be propagated to the averaged position. Both options handle the column }TIME' differently: while \verb{subsample' returns the actual timestamp (in UNIX TIME) of each sample, }aggregate' returns the
mean timestamp (also in UNIX TIME).
In both cases, an extra column, \code{time_agg}, is added which has a uniform
difference between each element corresponding to the user-defined thinning
interval.
The `aggregate' option only recognises errors named \code{varx} and
\code{vary}.
If all of these columns are not present together the function assumes there
is no measure of error, and drops those columns.
If there is actually no measure of error, the function simply returns the
averaged position and covariates in each time interval.
Grouping variables' names (such as animal identity) may be passed as a
character vector to the \code{id_columns} argument.
