\title{Get residence patch data.}
\usage{
atl_patch_summary(patch_data, which_data = "summary", buffer_radius = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{patch_data}{A data.frame with a nested list column of the raw data
underlying each patch. Since data.frames don't support nested columns,
will actually be a data.table or similar extension.}

\item{which_data}{Which data to return. May be the raw data underlying the
patch (\code{which_data = "points"}),
or a spatial features (\code{sf-MULTIPOLYGON}) object with patch covariates
(\code{which_data = "spatial"}), or a data.table of the patch covariates
without the geometry column (\code{which_data = "summary"}).}

\item{buffer_radius}{Spatial buffer radius (in metres) around points when
requesting sf based polygons.}
}
\value{
An object of type \code{sf} or \code{data.table} depending on
which data is requested.
}
\description{
The function \code{atl_patch_summary} can be used to extract patch-specific
summary data such as the median coordinates, the patch duration, the distance
travelled within the patch, the displacement within the patch, and the patch
area.

\examples{
\dontrun{
patch_summary <- atl_patch_summary(
  patch_data = patches,
  which_data = "summary",
  buffer_radius = 10
