   pages = {31-40},
   abstract = {Evidence is accumulating that foraging behaviour and diet link to personality traits, yet little is known about how these associations emerge during development. Behaviour is expected to become more consistent with age and with foraging experience. We compared exploratory behaviour and diet variances of juvenile and adult red knots, Calidris canutus islandica, shortly after migration to marine intertidal mudflats from terrestrial tundra breeding grounds. By identifying the timing of the switch from terrestrial to marine isotopic signatures, we were also able to ask whether juveniles that arrived earlier, and thus had longer experiences in a particular environment (nonbreeding grounds), were more consistent in exploration behaviour. We found that juveniles had a more diverse diet and were less repeatable in their exploratory behaviour than adults. This change in repeatability was largely driven by greater within-individual behavioural variance in the juveniles compared to the adults. The amount of time juveniles experienced in a marine environment did not affect the variation in their exploratory behaviour, suggesting that consistency in exploration was developed over a longer period than the 4 weeks of our study. Our findings suggest that after initial exploration of a novel habitat, juveniles likely try out foraging techniques which later develop into consistent behaviours that differ between individuals. This study illuminates how personality can develop with experience in a free-living animal.},

   journal = {Ecology and Evolution},
   volume = {14},

   pages = {e10954},
   abstract = {Abstract Deciding when to depart on long-distance, sometimes global, movements can be especially important for flying species. Adverse weather conditions can affect energetic flight costs and navigational ability. While departure timings and conditions have been well-studied for migratory flights to and from the breeding range, few studies have focussed on flights within the non-breeding season. Yet in some cases, overwintering ranges can be large enough that ecological barriers, and a lack of resting sites en route, may resist movement, especially in unfavorable environmental conditions. Understanding the conditions that will enable or prohibit flights within an overwintering range is particularly relevant in light of climate change, whereby increases in extreme weather events may reduce the connectivity of sites. We tracked 495 (n = 251 in 2019; n = 244 in 2020) overwintering red knots (Calidris canutus islandica) in the Dutch Wadden Sea and investigated how many departed towards the UK (on westward relocation flights), which requires flying over the North Sea. For those that departed, we used a resource selection model to determine the effect of environmental conditions on the timing of relocation flights. Specifically, we investigated the effects of wind, rain, atmospheric pressure, cloud cover, and migratory timing relative to sunset and tidal cycle, which have all been shown to be crucial to migratory departure conditions. Approximately 37% (2019) and 36% (2020) of tagged red knots departed on westward relocation flights, indicating differences between individuals' space use within the overwintering range. Red knots selected for departures between 1 and 2.5 h after sunset, approximately 4 h before high tide, with tailwinds and little cloud cover. However, rainfall and changes in atmospheric pressure appear unimportant. Our study reveals environmental conditions that are important for relocation flights across an ecological barrier, indicating potential consequences of climate change on connectivity.},

   abstract = {Abstract The timing of animal migrations is an interplay between migration programmes and physiological and environmental conditions. The rate of body store deposition underlies many timing options, with a key unresolved question being whether the rate of body store deposition and resource constraints limit advancements in migration departure. To study limits of deposition on departure timing, we captured red knots (Calidris canutus islandica) wintering in the Wadden Sea and manipulated hours of food access per day during spring body store deposition and prenuptial moulting phases. These birds were then released and tracked until spring migration departure from the Wadden Sea. When birds were allowed to feed more hours per day in captivity, they did not start body store deposition and plumage moult earlier, but gained stores faster, were heavier and had further progressed in prenuptial feather moult at the moment of release. After release, birds that had ad libitum access to food in captivity departed earliest from the Wadden Sea, and departure timing was explained by the rate of mass deposition in captivity. We experimentally demonstrate flexibility in the timing of annual-cycle processes during spring migration. Red knots are flexible to adjust the rate of mass gain and moult to food availability, in turn allowing them flexibility in departure timing. This indicates that improvements in foraging conditions at staging sites will facilitate earlier departures, which will help migratory birds to keep pace with global warming.

   abstract = {Understanding animal movement is essential to elucidate how animals interact, survive, and thrive in a changing world. Recent technological advances in data collection and management have transformed our understanding of animal “movement ecology” (the integrated study of organismal movement), creating a big-data discipline that benefits from rapid, cost-effective generation of large amounts of data on movements of animals in the wild. These high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allow more thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species across space and time, the nature of biological interactions, and behavioral responses to the environment. Movement ecology is rapidly expanding scientific frontiers through large interdisciplinary and collaborative frameworks, providing improved opportunities for conservation and insights into the movements of wild animals, and their causes and consequences. So-called “big-data” approaches have revolutionized fields of research from astronomy to genetics. Such approaches are not limited to fields that seem inherently technical, because the combination of rapid data collection and advanced analytical techniques could be applied to almost any scientific question. Nathan et al. reviewed how these modern approaches are being applied to the very old field of animal tracking and monitoring. Large-scale data collection can reveal details about how animals use their environment and interact with each other that were impossible to explore previously. Such methodological shifts will open new avenues of research—and conservation—across species. —SNV A review suggests that modern “big-data” techniques are vastly increasing our understanding of animal movement and its ecology.},
