  abstract = {Abstract Fine-scale tracking of animal movement is important to understand the proximate mechanisms of animal behaviour. The reverse-GPS system—ATLAS—uses inexpensive (~€25), lightweight (<1 g) and low-power (~0.4 mJ/transmission) tags. Six systems are now operational worldwide and have successfully tracked over 50 species in various landscape types. The growing use of ATLAS to track animal movement motivates further refinement of best-practice application and an assessment of its accuracy. Here, we test the accuracy and precision of the largest ATLAS system, located in the Dutch Wadden Sea, using concurrent GPS measurements as a reference. This large-scale ATLAS system consists of 26 receivers and covers 1,326 km2 of intertidal region, with almost no physical obstacles for radio signals, providing a useful baseline for other systems. We compared ATLAS and GPS location estimates for a route (mobile test) and 16 fixed locations (stationary test) on the Griend mudflat. Precision was estimated using standard deviation during the stationary tests. We also give examples of tracked red knots Calidris canutus islandica to illustrate the use of the system in tracking small shorebirds (~120 g). ATLAS-derived location estimates differed from GPS by a median of 4.2 m (stationary test) and 5.7 m (mobile test). Signals that were collected by more receiver stations were more accurate, although even three-receiver localisations were comparable with GPS localisations (~10 m difference). Receivers that detected 90\% of the 1 Hz transmissions from our test tag were within 5 km of their furthest detection but height of both receiver and tag seemed to influence detection distance. The test tag (1 Hz) had a fix rate of >90\% at 15 of 16 stationary sites. Tags on birds (1/6 Hz) on the Griend mudflat had a mean fix rate of 51\%, yielding an average sampling rate of 0.085 Hz. Fix rates were higher in more central parts of the receiver array. ATLAS provides accurate, regional-scale tracking with which hundreds of relatively small-bodied species can be tracked simultaneously for long periods of time. Future ATLAS users should consider the height of receivers, their spatial arrangement, density and the movement modes of their study species (e.g. ground-dwelling or flying).},

  abstract = {Abstract Modern, high-throughput animal tracking increasingly yields ‘big data’ at very fine temporal scales. At these scales, location error can exceed the animal's step size, leading to mis-estimation of behaviours inferred from movement. ‘Cleaning’ the data to reduce location errors is one of the main ways to deal with position uncertainty. Although data cleaning is widely recommended, inclusive, uniform guidance on this crucial step, and on how to organise the cleaning of massive datasets, is relatively scarce. A pipeline for cleaning massive high-throughput datasets must balance ease of use and computationally efficiency, in which location errors are rejected while preserving valid animal movements. Another useful feature of a pre-processing pipeline is efficiently segmenting and clustering location data for statistical methods while also being scalable to large datasets and robust to imperfect sampling. Manual methods being prohibitively time-consuming, and to boost reproducibility, pre-processing pipelines must be automated. We provide guidance on building pipelines for pre-processing high-throughput animal tracking data to prepare it for subsequent analyses. We apply our proposed pipeline to simulated movement data with location errors, and also show how large volumes of cleaned data can be transformed into biologically meaningful ‘residence patches’, for exploratory inference on animal space use. We use tracking data from the Wadden Sea ATLAS system (WATLAS) to show how pre-processing improves its quality, and to verify the usefulness of the residence patch method. Finally, with tracks from Egyptian fruit bats Rousettus aegyptiacus, we demonstrate the pre-processing pipeline and residence patch method in a fully worked out example. To help with fast implementation of standardised methods, we developed the R package atlastools, which we also introduce here. Our pre-processing pipeline and atlastools can be used with any high-throughput animal movement data in which the high data-volume combined with knowledge of the tracked individuals' movement capacity can be used to reduce location errors. atlastools is easy to use for beginners while providing a template for further development. The common use of simple yet robust pre-processing steps promotes standardised methods in the field of movement ecology and leads to better inferences from data.},
