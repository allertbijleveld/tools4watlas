  abstract = {Evidence is accumulating that foraging behaviour and diet link to personality traits, yet little is known about how these associations emerge during development. Behaviour is expected to become more consistent with age and with foraging experience. We compared exploratory behaviour and diet variances of juvenile and adult red knots, Calidris canutus islandica, shortly after migration to marine intertidal mudflats from terrestrial tundra breeding grounds. By identifying the timing of the switch from terrestrial to marine isotopic signatures, we were also able to ask whether juveniles that arrived earlier, and thus had longer experiences in a particular environment (nonbreeding grounds), were more consistent in exploration behaviour. We found that juveniles had a more diverse diet and were less repeatable in their exploratory behaviour than adults. This change in repeatability was largely driven by greater within-individual behavioural variance in the juveniles compared to the adults. The amount of time juveniles experienced in a marine environment did not affect the variation in their exploratory behaviour, suggesting that consistency in exploration was developed over a longer period than the 4 weeks of our study. Our findings suggest that after initial exploration of a novel habitat, juveniles likely try out foraging techniques which later develop into consistent behaviours that differ between individuals. This study illuminates how personality can develop with experience in a free-living animal.}

  abstract = {Abstract Fine-scale tracking of animal movement is important to understand the proximate mechanisms of animal behaviour. The reverse-GPS system—ATLAS—uses inexpensive (~€25), lightweight (<1 g) and low-power (~0.4 mJ/transmission) tags. Six systems are now operational worldwide and have successfully tracked over 50 species in various landscape types. The growing use of ATLAS to track animal movement motivates further refinement of best-practice application and an assessment of its accuracy. Here, we test the accuracy and precision of the largest ATLAS system, located in the Dutch Wadden Sea, using concurrent GPS measurements as a reference. This large-scale ATLAS system consists of 26 receivers and covers 1,326 km2 of intertidal region, with almost no physical obstacles for radio signals, providing a useful baseline for other systems. We compared ATLAS and GPS location estimates for a route (mobile test) and 16 fixed locations (stationary test) on the Griend mudflat. Precision was estimated using standard deviation during the stationary tests. We also give examples of tracked red knots Calidris canutus islandica to illustrate the use of the system in tracking small shorebirds (~120 g). ATLAS-derived location estimates differed from GPS by a median of 4.2 m (stationary test) and 5.7 m (mobile test). Signals that were collected by more receiver stations were more accurate, although even three-receiver localisations were comparable with GPS localisations (~10 m difference). Receivers that detected 90\% of the 1 Hz transmissions from our test tag were within 5 km of their furthest detection but height of both receiver and tag seemed to influence detection distance. The test tag (1 Hz) had a fix rate of >90\% at 15 of 16 stationary sites. Tags on birds (1/6 Hz) on the Griend mudflat had a mean fix rate of 51\%, yielding an average sampling rate of 0.085 Hz. Fix rates were higher in more central parts of the receiver array. ATLAS provides accurate, regional-scale tracking with which hundreds of relatively small-bodied species can be tracked simultaneously for long periods of time. Future ATLAS users should consider the height of receivers, their spatial arrangement, density and the movement modes of their study species (e.g. ground-dwelling or flying).},

  abstract = {Abstract Variation in foraging tactics and diet is usually attributed to differences in morphology, experience and prey availability. Recently, consistent individual differences in behaviour (personality) have been shown to be associated with foraging strategies. Bolder or more exploratory individuals are predicted to have a faster pace-of-life and offset the costs of moving more or in risky areas, with higher energetic gains by encountering profitable foraging opportunities and prey. However, the relationship between personality, foraging and diet is poorly understood. We investigated how exploratory behaviour in red knots Calidris canutus is associated with foraging tactics and diet by combining laboratory experiments, field observations and stable isotope analysis. First, we developed a mobile experimental arena to measure exploration speed in controlled settings. We validated the method by repeated testing of individuals over time and contexts. This setup allowed us to measure exploratory personality at the field site, eliminating the need to bring birds into captivity for long periods of time. After releasing birds within days of their capture, we asked whether exploration speed was associated with differences in foraging tactics and diet in the wild. We found that tactile foraging red knots mainly caught hard-shelled prey that are buried in the sediment, whereas visual foraging knots only captured soft preys located close to or on the surface. We also found that faster explorers showed a higher percentage of visual foraging than slower explorers. By contrast, morphology (bill length and gizzard size) had no significant effect on foraging tactics. Diet analysis based on δ15N and δ13C stable isotope values of plasma and red blood cells confirmed our field observations with slower explorers mainly consumed hard-shelled prey while faster explorers consumed more soft than hard-shelled prey. Our results show that foraging tactics and diet are associated with a personality trait, independent of morphological differences. We discuss how consistent behaviour might develop early in life through positive feedbacks between foraging tactics, prey type and foraging efficiency.},

  abstract = {Abstract Modern, high-throughput animal tracking increasingly yields ‘big data’ at very fine temporal scales. At these scales, location error can exceed the animal's step size, leading to mis-estimation of behaviours inferred from movement. ‘Cleaning’ the data to reduce location errors is one of the main ways to deal with position uncertainty. Although data cleaning is widely recommended, inclusive, uniform guidance on this crucial step, and on how to organise the cleaning of massive datasets, is relatively scarce. A pipeline for cleaning massive high-throughput datasets must balance ease of use and computationally efficiency, in which location errors are rejected while preserving valid animal movements. Another useful feature of a pre-processing pipeline is efficiently segmenting and clustering location data for statistical methods while also being scalable to large datasets and robust to imperfect sampling. Manual methods being prohibitively time-consuming, and to boost reproducibility, pre-processing pipelines must be automated. We provide guidance on building pipelines for pre-processing high-throughput animal tracking data to prepare it for subsequent analyses. We apply our proposed pipeline to simulated movement data with location errors, and also show how large volumes of cleaned data can be transformed into biologically meaningful ‘residence patches’, for exploratory inference on animal space use. We use tracking data from the Wadden Sea ATLAS system (WATLAS) to show how pre-processing improves its quality, and to verify the usefulness of the residence patch method. Finally, with tracks from Egyptian fruit bats Rousettus aegyptiacus, we demonstrate the pre-processing pipeline and residence patch method in a fully worked out example. To help with fast implementation of standardised methods, we developed the R package atlastools, which we also introduce here. Our pre-processing pipeline and atlastools can be used with any high-throughput animal movement data in which the high data-volume combined with knowledge of the tracked individuals' movement capacity can be used to reduce location errors. atlastools is easy to use for beginners while providing a template for further development. The common use of simple yet robust pre-processing steps promotes standardised methods in the field of movement ecology and leads to better inferences from data.},

  abstract = {Understanding animal movement is essential to elucidate how animals interact, survive, and thrive in a changing world. Recent technological advances in data collection and management have transformed our understanding of animal “movement ecology” (the integrated study of organismal movement), creating a big-data discipline that benefits from rapid, cost-effective generation of large amounts of data on movements of animals in the wild. These high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allow more thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species across space and time, the nature of biological interactions, and behavioral responses to the environment. Movement ecology is rapidly expanding scientific frontiers through large interdisciplinary and collaborative frameworks, providing improved opportunities for conservation and insights into the movements of wild animals, and their causes and consequences. So-called “big-data” approaches have revolutionized fields of research from astronomy to genetics. Such approaches are not limited to fields that seem inherently technical, because the combination of rapid data collection and advanced analytical techniques could be applied to almost any scientific question. Nathan et al. reviewed how these modern approaches are being applied to the very old field of animal tracking and monitoring. Large-scale data collection can reveal details about how animals use their environment and interact with each other that were impossible to explore previously. Such methodological shifts will open new avenues of research—and conservation—across species. —SNV A review suggests that modern “big-data” techniques are vastly increasing our understanding of animal movement and its ecology.}
