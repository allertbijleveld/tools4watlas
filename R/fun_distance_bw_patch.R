#' Get the distance between patches.
#'
#' Gets the linear distance between the first point of patch \code{i} and
#' the last point of the previous patch patch \code{i - 1}.
#' Distance is returned in metres.
#' This function is used internally by other functions, and rarely on its own.

#' @author Pratik R. Gupte
#' @param data A dataframe of or extending the class data.frame, such as a
#' data.table.
#' This must contain two pairs of coordinates, the start and end X and Y
#' coordinates of a feature.
#' @param x1 The first X coordinate or longitude; for inter-patch distances,
#' this is the last coordinate (x_end) of a patch \eqn{i}.
#' @param x2 The second X coordinate; for inter-patch distances, this is the
#' first coordinate (x_start) of a subsequent patch \eqn{i + 1}.
#' @param y1 The first Y coordinate or latitude; for inter-patch distances,
#' this is the last coordinate (y_end) of a patch \eqn{i}.
#' @param y2 The second Y coordinate; for inter-patch distances, this is the
#' first coordinate (y_start) of a subsequent patch \eqn{i + 1}.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector of the length of the number of patches, or rows in
#' the input dataframe.
#' For single patches, returns \code{NA}.
#' The vector has as its elements \code{NA}, followed by
#' n-1 distances, where n is the number of rows.
