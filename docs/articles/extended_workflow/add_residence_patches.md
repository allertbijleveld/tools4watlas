# Add residence patches

In this vignette, we provide a general workflow to group WATLAS position
data into so-called ‘residence patches’.

## Background

The
[`atl_res_patch()`](https://allertbijleveld.github.io/tools4watlas/reference/atl_res_patch.md)
function is designed to segment and aggregate WATLAS movement data into
residence patches. The main parameter is speed `max_speed`. With perfect
data that would be the only parameter necessary to adjust, because the
speed flying, walking or standing do not overlap. Because WATLAS data
have localization error (which is comparable to GPS, see [Beardsworth et
al. 2022](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13913))
and gaps when birds are not detected by receivers, we need to have
additional variables for classifying these data into robust residence
patches.

The logic of the function is to first identify proto-patches
(preliminary residence patches). Subsequent positions are assigned to
the same proto-patch when they have a speed smaller than `max_speed`, a
distance smaller than `lim_spat_indep` and a time gap smaller than
`lim_time_indep`. Proto-patches with fewer than `min_fixes` positions
and shorter than `min_duration` are filtered out.

For each proto-patch, the median position is calculated as well as the
time between subsequent proto-patches (i.e. the time between the last
position of a proto-patch and the first position of the next
proto-patch). If the distance between the median positions of two
subsequent proto-patches is smaller than `lim_spat_indep` and the time
between the proto-patch is less then `lim_time_indep`, proto-patches are
merged into residence patches.

Lastly, a unique patch ID is assigned to each residence patch ordered by
time from 1 to n.

Note that position error in combination with short intervals between
positions (e.g. 3 sec) can lead to speed outliers that affect the
creation of proto-patches. Therefore, it is recommended to first filter
(e.g. `var_max < 5000`) and smooth (e.g. `moving_window = 5`) the data.

## Parameter overview

Deciding on the optimal parameters for the residence patch
classification is not a trivial task. The key is to find a good balance
between true and false positives. See section below on how we decided on
the standard parameter settings.

- **`max_speed`:** A numeric value specifying the maximum speed (m/s)
  between two subsequent positions that would be considered
  non-transitory. **3 m/s** seems to be the best compromise. Higher
  values often result in the merging of patches with clear flights in
  between and with lower values clear foraging behaviour is sometimes
  not picked up.
- **`lim_spat_indep`:** A numeric value specifying the maximum
  distance (m) between subsequent residence patches for them to be
  considered independent. In combination with `lim_time_indep`, this
  parameter avoids making a new proto-patch from gaps in the data when
  the bird was actually still at the same location. **75 m** seems to be
  the best compromise.
- **`lim_time_indep`:** A numeric value specifying the time difference
  (min) between two subsequent residence patches for them to be
  considered independent. In combination with `lim_spat_indep`, this
  parameter can prevent the creation new proto-patches when there are
  large gaps in the data. For example, at the roost site a bird might
  not move for a long time at a location with poor coverage by
  receivers. If the bird then moves away and sends data from the same
  position, we can assume that all missed positions were also at this
  place. **180 min** (3 hours) works fine for foraging, but it could be
  increased with position data that has large gaps. For example, when
  the analysis is focused on roosting behaviour, this could even be
  increased to e.g. 12 hours, to deal with large gaps in the data that
  can occur with roosting birds not moving and being at the same place
  with bad signal strength.
- **`min_fixes`:** The minimum number of positions for proto-patches. To
  make sure that residence patches have at least a few positions. **2
  positions** works best in picking up proto-patches. If the patch is
  below `min_duration` it will anyway be filtered out.
- **`min_duration`:** The minimum duration (s) for classifying residence
  patches. With a high-sampling interval (e.g. 3 s), short residence
  patches can be created, which are not biological relevant. A value of
  **60 sec** (1 minute) helps to pick-up proto-patches. Biological
  relevance depends on the focus of the analysis and residence patches
  with a shorter duration can still be filtered out afterwards.

## Example workflow

### Load packages and required data

Note that access to the tidal data on WATLAS-Teams is required for
running this code.

``` r
# packages
library(tools4watlas)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(patchwork)
library(foreach)
library(doFuture)

# load example data
data <- data_example

# file path to WATLAS teams data folder
fp <- atl_file_path("watlas_teams")

# sub path to tide data
tidal_pattern_fp <- paste0(
  fp, "waterdata/allYears-tidalPattern-west_terschelling-UTC.csv"
)
measured_water_height_fp <- paste0(
  fp, "waterdata/allYears-gemeten_waterhoogte-west_terschelling-clean-UTC.csv"
)

# load tide data
tidal_pattern <- fread(tidal_pattern_fp)
measured_water_height <- fread(measured_water_height_fp)
```

### Calculate residence patches by tag

To reduce the memory size for parallel computing, we will first subset
the relevant columns from the data. This could be skipped for small data
tables. We will then run
[`atl_res_patch()`](https://allertbijleveld.github.io/tools4watlas/reference/atl_res_patch.md)
for each tag ID in parallel. The column `patch` is added to the data
table, which provides the assigned patch ID’s for the positions.

``` r
# subset relevant columns
data <- data[, .(species, posID, tag, time, datetime, x, y, tideID)]

# extract the unique tag IDs
id <- unique(data$tag)

# register cores and backend for parallel processing
registerDoFuture()
plan(multisession)

# loop through all tags to calculate residence patches
data <- foreach(i = id, .combine = "rbind") %dofuture% {
  atl_res_patch(
    data[tag == i],
    max_speed = 3, lim_spat_indep = 75, lim_time_indep = 180,
    min_fixes = 2, min_duration = 60
  )
}

# close parallel processing
plan(sequential)

# show head of the summary table
head(data) |> knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| species | posID | tag | time | datetime | x | y | tideID | patch |
|:---|---:|:---|---:|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|

### Evaluate residence-patch assignment

The function
[`atl_check_res_patch()`](https://allertbijleveld.github.io/tools4watlas/reference/atl_check_res_patch.md)
can be used to evaluate the residence patch assignment by tag and tide
ID. The function plots the track with residence patches on a map and
shows the duration (time in a patch in min) as coloured polygon on the
map and against time in a separate panel. Time starts on the top and
goes from high tide to the next high tide (solid blue lines), as well as
indicating low tide (dashed blue line). The title of the plot gives
basic information about the data and the water level for the
corresponding tide.

#### Inspect one tag and tide

We can select one tag and tide to plot. Additionally, we need to specify
the offset for the tidal data we use (e.g. 30 min for West-Terschelling)
and a buffer (in m) around the residence patch data to create the
polygon (for visualisation purposes only). For data inspection, it makes
sense to set the buffer to half of `lim_spat_indep` (maximum distance
between subsequent residence patches at which they will be considered
independent), ensuring that the polygons around residence patches
correspond to the spatial distance threshold used to merge residence
patches.

``` r
atl_check_res_patch(
  data[tag == "3038"],
  tide_data = tidal_pattern, tide_data_highres = measured_water_height,
  tide = "2023513", offset = 30,
  buffer_res_patches = 75 / 2
)
```

![Overview plot res patches one
tide](add_residence_patches_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

It might also be convenient to zoom in on specifc range of residence
patches, to inspect them in more detail.

``` r
# set parameters for subsetting data
tag_id <- "3038"
tide_id <- "2023513"
from_patch <- 6
to_patch <- 11

atl_check_res_patch(
  data[
    tag == tag_id &
      datetime >= data[
        tag == tag_id & tideID == tide_id & patch == from_patch, min(datetime)
      ] &
      datetime <= data[
        tag == tag_id & tideID == tide_id & patch == to_patch, max(datetime)
      ]
  ],
  tide_data = tidal_pattern, tide_data_highres = measured_water_height,
  tide = tide_id, offset = 30,
  buffer_res_patches = 15,
  buffer_bm = 50,
  patch_label_padding = 2
)
```

![Overview plot res patches one
tide](add_residence_patches_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

#### Inspect many tags and tides

To get a general overview of the performance of residence patch
assignment, we can also loop through and plot all data by tag and tide,
or for example a random sample of 100 tags and tides. The plots can be
saved in any directory (e.g. `./outputs/res_patch_check/`), which has to
be created before running the code.

``` r
# create table with data combinations to plot
idc <- unique(data[, c("species", "tag", "tideID")])

# sample 100 combinations to plot
set.seed(123)
idc <- idc[sample(.N, 100)]

# register cores and backend for parallel processing
registerDoFuture()
plan(multisession)

# loop to make plots for all
foreach(i = seq_len(nrow(idc))) %dofuture% {

  # plot and save for each combination
  atl_check_res_patch(
    data[tag == idc$tag[i]],
    tide_data = tidal_pattern,
    tide_data_highres = measured_water_height,
    tide = idc$tideID[i], offset = 30,
    buffer_res_patches = 75 / 2,
    filename = paste0(
      "./outputs/res_patch_check/",
      idc$species[i], "_tag_", idc$tag[i], "_tide_", idc$tideID[i]
    )
  )

}

# close parallel processing
plan(sequential)
```

Based on these plots and perhaps additional checks, the parameters can
be adjusted to improve the assignment of residence patches. See the
section below on choosing the best parameter settings.

### Summary of residence patch data

Once satisfied with the residence patch assignment, we can summarize the
residence patches by tag and patch ID and merge the desired columns back
to our full data table.

``` r
# summary of residence patches
data_summary <- atl_res_patch_summary(data)

# standardise duration to minutes
data_summary[, duration := duration / 60]

# merge desired summary columns with original data table
data[data_summary, on = c("tag", "patch"), `:=`(
  duration = i.duration,
  disp_in_patch = i.disp_in_patch
)]

# show head of the summary table
head(data_summary) |> knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

## Plotting residence patches

Residence patches can be conveniently plotted using `ggplot2`. Here, we
will show plotting residence patchs by individuals or species.

### Plot by individual

Here, we will provide three examples of plotting residence patches for
one red knot (tag 3038).

#### Plot track coloured by patch ID

In the first example, the residence patches are coloured by patch ID. To
show the full track, the transient (unassigned) positions are plotted in
grey.

``` r
# subset red knot
data_subset <- data[tag == 3038]
data_summary_subset <- data_summary[tag == 3038]

# create basemap
bm <- atl_create_bm(data_subset, buffer = 500)

# track with residence patches coloured
bm +
  geom_path(data = data_subset, aes(x, y), alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_point(
    data = data_subset, aes(x, y), color = "grey",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  geom_point(
    data = data_subset[!is.na(patch)], aes(x, y, color = as.character(patch)),
    size = 1.5, show.legend = FALSE
  )
```

![residence patches within track colored by
ID](add_residence_patches_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

#### Plot residence patches coloured by patch ID

In the second example, the residence patches are plotted at their median
positions with the size and colour scaled to their duration (in
minutes).

``` r
# plot residence patches itself by duration
bm +
  geom_point(
    data = data_summary_subset,
    aes(x_median, y_median, color = duration, size = duration),
    show.legend = TRUE, alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  scale_color_viridis()
```

![residence patches by duration in
patch](add_residence_patches_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

#### Plot track with residence patches as polygons

In the third example, we will calculate polygons around the residence
patches and plot them

``` r
# make patch character for plotting
data_subset[, patch := as.character(patch)]

# create polygons around residence patches
d_sf <- atl_as_sf(
  data_subset,
  additional_cols = "patch",
  option = "res_patches", buffer = 75 / 2
)

# geom_sf overwrites the coordinate system, so we need to set the limits again
bbox <- atl_bbox(data_subset, buffer = 500)

# plot polygons around residence patches
bm +
  # add patch polygons
  geom_sf(data = d_sf, aes(fill = patch), alpha = 0.2) +
  # add track and points
  geom_path(
    data = data_subset, aes(x, y),
    linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_point(
    data = data_subset[is.na(patch)], aes(x, y),
    size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5, color = "grey20",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  geom_point(
    data = data_subset[!is.na(patch)], aes(x, y, color = patch),
    size = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  # set extend again (overwritten by geom_sf)
  coord_sf(
    xlim = c(bbox["xmin"], bbox["xmax"]),
    ylim = c(bbox["ymin"], bbox["ymax"]), expand = FALSE
  )
```

![residence patches by duration in
patch](add_residence_patches_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

### Plot by species

Similarly, we can plot the residence patches by species. For this, we
need to merge the species information back to the summary table for
residence patches. The residence patches are coloured by species and
scaled by duration (in minutes).

``` r
# create basemap
bm <- atl_create_bm(data, buffer = 500)

# add species
du <- unique(data, by = "tag")
data_summary <- data_summary[du, on = "tag", `:=`(species = i.species)]

# plot residence patches itself by duration and species
bm +
  geom_point(
    data = data_summary,
    aes(x_median, y_median, color = species, size = duration),
    show.legend = TRUE, alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = atl_spec_cols(),
    labels = atl_spec_labs("multiline"),
    name = ""
  )
```

## Choosing the best parameters

Selecting appropriate parameters for assigning residence patches was
based on a combination of biological relevance, visual inspection,
systematic testing, and expert judgement.

First, ‘min_duration’, ‘lim_time_indep’, and ‘min_fixes’ were set. To
maintain biological relevance for the creation of proto-pacthes, a
minimum duration of 60 s and temporal limit of 180 min were selected
a-priori. Additionally, a minimum of 2 positions for a proto-patch was
selected to avoid the creation of too many proto-patches with very short
(biologically irrelevant) durations. These parameter settings were
extensively evaluated using visual inspection.

Second, we systematically tested a range of values for two key
parameters: `max_speed` and `lim_spat_indep` . Keeping all other
parameters constant (see above), we varied `max_speed` between 2, 3, 4,
and 5 m/s, and `lim_spat_indep` between 50, 75, and 100 m. For each
combination of parameter values and for eight shorebird species tracked
in the Wadden Sea in 2023, residence patches were computed for a subset
of 100 randomly selected tag–tide combinations per species (with the
condition that there are at least 500 positions per tag-tide
combination). We then did a pair-wise comparison of parameter settings
using
[`atl_compare_res_patch_summary()`](https://allertbijleveld.github.io/tools4watlas/reference/atl_compare_res_patch_summary.md),
which highlighted all new, lost, merged and split residence patches.
From this summary, we then selected a subset of 100 random changes that
were plotted using
[`atl_compare_res_patch_plot()`](https://allertbijleveld.github.io/tools4watlas/reference/atl_compare_res_patch_plot.md).
The 100 resulting plots of pair-wise comparisons were then scored by
three expert observers. The observers could choose “left much better”,
“left slightly better”, “similar”, “right slightly better”, or “right
much better”.

Based on the systematic evaluation of parameter settings (see the figure
below), a `max_speed` of 3 m/s and a `lim_spat_indep` of 75 m performed
best.

![residence patches
rating](add_residence_patches_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

**Example workflow for choosing parameter values:**

In this example, comparing 3 m/s and 4 m/s, the patches are wrongly
merged when using 4 m/s, so the 3 m/s (left) was rated as “left much
better”.

``` r
# load example data
data <- data_example

# run atl_res_patch with two different parameter sets
data_v1 <- atl_res_patch(
  data[tag == "3100"],
  max_speed = 3, lim_spat_indep = 75, lim_time_indep = 180,
  min_fixes = 2, min_duration = 60
)
data_v2 <- atl_res_patch(
  data[tag == "3100"],
  max_speed = 4, lim_spat_indep = 75, lim_time_indep = 180,
  min_fixes = 2, min_duration = 60
)

# change summary
change_summary <- atl_compare_res_patch_summary(data_v1, data_v2)
```

    ## === Patch changes summary ===
    ## Lost    (v1 patches gone in v2) : 0 
    ## Gained  (new patches in v2)     : 0 
    ## 
    ## Splits  (one v1 -> multiple v2): 0 
    ## Merges  (multiple v1 -> one v2): 1

``` r
# plot specific change
i <- 1

atl_compare_res_patch_plot(
  data_v1 = data_v1,
  data_v2 = data_v2,
