### Introduction

Tracking animal movement is crucial for understanding interactions with
changing environments and predicting the effects of anthropogenic
activities, particularly in ecologically significant areas like the
Wadden Sea. The WATLAS system (Wadden Sea Advanced Tracking and
Localisation of Animals in real life Systems) enables high-resolution
monitoring of small bird movements, offering insights into space use,
individual variation, and social networks, thereby supporting research
and conservation efforts in the region. A detailed description of WATLAS
can be found in **Bijleveld et al. ([2022](#ref-bijleveld2022))**.

In **Nathan et al. ([2022](#ref-nathan2022))** we discuss how big-data
approaches, such as high-throughput tracking with WATLAS, can lead to an
increased understanding of the ecology of animal movement. Particularly
that advances in high-throughput wildlife tracking systems now allow
more thorough investigation of variation among individuals and species
across space and time, the nature of biological interactions, and
behavioral responses to the environment.

### Prologue to WATLAS

ATLAS builds on and is inspired by ‘Time Of Arrival’-tracking developed
by **R. B. MacCurdy & Richard M. Gabrielson
([2009](#ref-maccurdy2009))**. This tracking method is described in **R.
B. MacCurdy et al. ([2018](#ref-maccurdy2019))** that also includes a
pilot study in the Wadden Sea as a ‘proof of concept’. In the chapter
**R. MacCurdy et al. ([2015](#ref-maccurdyinthesis))**, we reviewed
tracking technologies and discussed how many of the tools are
inapplicable to many species due to mass, cost and energy constraints,
leaving gaps in our understanding. We presented the new ‘Time Of
Arrival’-tracking and argue that this can be broadly applied to species
that were previously too small for automated tracking systems at low
costs, thus offering researchers unprecedented amounts of data allowing
for novel insights.

After these initial tests in 2008-2009, this pre-WATLAS TOA-system was
deployed in the Wadden Sea with 15 receivers studying red knot habitat
use. After much trial and error, we could show in **Bijleveld et al.
([2016](#ref-bijleveld2016))** how red knots selected habitat to
maximise their energy intake rates. They did, however, not select areas
with the highest density of prey but trade-off prey quantity and
quality. Moreover, individuals differed in how they leaned towards
quantity or quality of prey in selecting mudflat habitat.

After the success in the Wadden Sea, we also deployed TOA-tracking in
Mauritania. Consistent with previous empirical studies, patch residence
times in the field were positively correlated with gizzard mass. A
manipulation of gizzard mass through diet revealed that Red Knots with
experimentally reduced gizzard masses did not accordingly decreased
patch residence times in the field. These findings suggest that diet
preferences can cause the observed among-individual variation in gizzard
mass and patch residence times **([**oudman2017?**](#ref-oudman2017))**.

Having deployed the same tracking and resouce sampling methods in
Mauritania and the Wadden Sea allowed a comparisson within species
**([Oudman et al., 2018](#ref-oudman2018))**. Compared to Banc d’Arguin,
resource patches in the Wadden Sea were larger and the maximum local
resource abundance was higher. However, because of constraints set by
digestive capacity, the average potential intake rates by red knots were
similar at the two study sites. Space-use patterns differed as predicted
from these differences in resource landscapes. Foraging red knots in the
Wadden Sea roamed the mudflats in large aggregations without site
fidelity (i.e. grouping nomads), at Banc d’Arguin they acted more
individually with strong site-fidelity (i.e. solitary residents).

For a broader review on circadian rhythms, we re-analysed the high
resolution tracking data from Red Knots in Mauritanie. We revealed
individual differences in tidal and circadian foraging rhythms and
highlight potential fruitful avenues for further studies **([Bulla et
al., 2017](#ref-bulla2017))**.

### Validation

Validation of methods is crucial for understanding the strengths and
limitations. In **Beardsworth et al. ([2022](#ref-beardsworth2022))** we
tested the accuracy and precision of WATLAS using concurrent GPS
measurements as a reference. The median accuracy of WATLAS was 4 m
compared with GPS localizations. Localizations that were collected by
more receiver stations were more accurate. The three-receiver
localizations provided an accuracy of 10 m, which increased to 3 m with
seven receivers contributing to the localization. Applying
Filter-Smoothing on the data further increased the accuracy to 6 m for
three-receiver localizations and to 2 m for seven-receiver
localizations.

### Methods

A pipeline with coding examples for cleaning (e.g. Filter-Smoothing)
high-throughput tracking data with `atlastools` (`tools4watlas` builds
on `atlastools`) is presented in **Gupte et al.
([2022](#ref-gupte2022))**.

In **Toledo et al. ([2022](#ref-toledo2022))** we describe our tags and
particulary the design of these versatile, widely-applicable, and
field-proven ‘Vildehaye’ tags for wildlife sensing and radio tracking.
Also, we discuss longevity of tags and show that WATLAS tags with a
CR2032 battery transmitting at 6 s can last 226 days.

### Ecology

#### Migration, relocation and departure decisions

Using WATLAS to record the timing of migration, we showed that red knots
that had ad libitum food in captivity departed earlier on spring
migration from the Wadden Sea than birds with restricted food access.
Becasue Red Knots adjust their mass gain and moult rates to local
foraging conditions, this study suggests that improved food conditions
at staging sites, like the Wadden Sea, could enable earlier departures
and help migratory birds better track advancing spring under climate
warming ([**Lameris2025?**](#ref-Lameris2025)).

In **Gobbens et al. ([2024](#ref-gobbens2024))**, we studied the
environmental conditions that red knots selected for relocation flights
within their wintering range across the North Sea to the United Kingdom.
Approximately 37% of tagged red knots departed yearly and on average did
so a few hours after sunset, 4h before high tide, with tailwinds, and
little cloud cover.

#### Habitat use and resource selection

We are interested whether shorebird select mudflat habitat where they
can maximise their energy intake rates, that is where food densities are
high. In **Penning et al. (in prep)**, we show that Sanderling select
intertidal mudflats with the highest densities of Brown Shrimp. Becasue
of tag weight constraints and Sanderling being so small, this is the
first time ever that Sanderling have been tracked at such high
spatiotemporal resolution.

In **Danielson-Owczynsky et al. (in prep)**, we show that Bar-tailed
Godwits select areas where they their preferred prey are most abundant.
For long-billed females these were areas with high densities of Lugworms
and Ragworms, which live deeper in the sediment. Males males with
shorter bills, however, almost exclusively consumed and selected areas
with high densities of Mud Shrimp that live more superficially on the
mudflats. The latter, that fuelling Bar-tailed godwits forage primarily
on Mud Shrimp, has not been documented before.

#### Individual variation

In **Ersoy et al. ([2022](#ref-ersoy2022))** we showed that foraging
tactics and diet are associated with the personality trait exploration,
independent of morphological differences. WATLAS was used to locate
tagged individuals on mudflats for detailed behavioural observations.

Following this result, in **Ersoy et al. ([2024](#ref-ersoy2024))**, we
studied the development of consistent exploration behaviour and found
that juvenile red knots had a more diverse diet than adults and had less
consistent personalites. We discuss a pathway how early foraging
experiences could shape development of exploratory personalities. WATLAS
was used to show how juvenile red knots differed in habitat use, which
is presented in the appendix.

#### Climate change

With the climiate crisis, extreme wind speeds are predicted to occur
more frequently and pose a threat to shorebirds. In **Timo Keuning et
al. (in prep)**, we studied how strong winds affect the availability of
intertidal foraging habitat through increased water levels (‘wind
setup’) and the behaviour of Red Knots. With high wind speeds from the
West, mudflats stayed submerged up to 50% and the availability of prey
was reduced by 44%. Moreover, with strong headwinds birds roosted
closer. These wind-driven effects are likely to increase energetic costs
while reducing opportunities for food intake, thereby reshaping energy
balances.

### PhD-dissertations

The pre-WATLAS insights were also published within the dissertations of
Thomas Oudman **([Oudman, 2017](#ref-oudmanthesis))** and Allert
Bijleveld **([Bijleveld, 2015](#ref-bijleveldthesis))**. so far, WATLAS
has been part of the dissertations of Eva Kok **([Kok,
2020](#ref-kokthesis))**, Selin Erosy **([Ersoy,
2022](#ref-ersoythesis))**, and Emma Penning **([Penning,
2023](#ref-penningthesis))**.
