# Get the file path for WATLAS or GIS data based on the user's name.

This function returns a predefined file path based on the user's system
username and the selected data type. Users must be predefined in the
function.

## Usage

``` r
atl_file_path(
  data_type = c("watlas_teams", "rasters", "shapefiles", "sqlite_db")
)
```

## Arguments

- data_type:

  A character string indicating the type of data. Options are:

  - `"watlas_teams"`: Path to “WATLAS” SharePoint folder:
    Documents/data/

  - `"rasters"`: Path to “Birds, fish ’n chips” SharePoint folder:
    Documents/data/GIS/rasters/

  - `"shapefiles"`: Path to “Birds, fish ’n chips” SharePoint folder:
    Documents/data/GIS/shapefiles/

  - `"sqlite_db"`: Path to ZEUS folder:
    ZEUS/cos/birds/bijleveld/fieldwork/WATLAS/localizations

## Value

A character string representing the full file path to the selected data
type for the current user.

## Details

For local users with access to the NIOZ network, I would recommend to
add a shortcut to your OneDrive of the “WATLAS” SharePoint folder:
Documents/data/. The path in the function then refers to this copy on
your OneDrive. Files in this folder (e.g. tags_watlas_all.xlsx and tide
data) are often updated and changes are then automatically updated on
your computer.

The second source of data is the “Birds, fish ’n chips” SharePoint
folder: Documents/data/GIS/ which has the subfolders rasters and
shapefiles. One can also create a OneDrive shortcut for this folder,
however it contains many large files and files usually don't change. I
would therefore recommend to only copy necessary data in a local folder
on your computer and then link the path to this folder.

To build all articles for the package website, you need to specify your
user paths here.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# test if all files can be accessed using atl_file_path() function

# packages
library(tools4watlas)

# file path to WATLAS teams data folder
fp <- atl_file_path("watlas_teams")
# check file path exists
file.exists(paste0(
  fp, "waterdata/allYears-tidalPattern-west_terschelling-UTC.csv"
))

# file path to Birds, fish 'n chips GIS/rasters folder
fp <- atl_file_path("rasters")
# check file path exists
file.exists(paste0(fp, "bathymetry/2024/bodemhoogte_20mtr_UTM31_int.tif"))


# file path to Birds, fish 'n chips GIS/shapefiles folder
fp <- atl_file_path("shapefiles")
# check file path exists
file.exists(
  paste0(fp, "open_street_map/land-polygons-complete-4326/land_polygons.shp")
)

# file path to sqlite databases
db_fp <- atl_file_path("sqlite_db")
# check file path exists
file.exists(
  paste0(db_fp, "watlas-2024.sqlite")
)
} # }
```
