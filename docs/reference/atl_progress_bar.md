# Display a live progress bar for PNG file generation in a directory

This function is meant to track the progress of PNG's created in a
parallel loop. It will check the number of PNG files in a specified
directory and make a progress bar in the console. To use the function,
open a new R session and run the function there.

## Usage

atl_progress_bar(file_path, total = NULL, refresh_rate = 1)
```

## Arguments

- file_path:

  reads from 'total_frames.txt' created by atl_time_steps() in the same
  directory.

  Numeric value in seconds specifying how often the progress bar
  updates.

## Value

No return value. Prints progress bar to the console.
